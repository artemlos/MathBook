MathBook
========

This is an open source book that has the following goals:

GOAL OF THE BOOK IS TO 
- TEACH SELF TAUGHT PEOPE ABOUT ALGORITHMS (Heavy emphasis on mathematics)
- WITH HEAVY FOCUS ON YOUTH YEAR 9-12
- PROMOTION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

**The approach**
* The programming lanaguge in which the examples are expressed is JavaScript, in order to allow a greater audience to try out example codes.
* Should not assume that something is "prior knowledge". All concepts described should allow as many people as possible to be able to relate to it. 

**The current structure of the book:**

1. Numeral systems (under construction)
2. Modular Arithmetic (almost done)

**Additional content to be added:**

1. Pattern recongnition in sequences
2. A chapter about the floor/ceiling functions
3. Intresting algorithms (add some from http://artemlos.net/docs/2013/10/ref2.pdf)
4. Classical encryption (should be a part of (3))
5. Text based games (should be a part of (3))
