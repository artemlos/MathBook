\section{Exercises}
An interesting exercise that can be found in \cite[p.49]{Pelerman1} can now be solved with the knowledge of numerical systems:
What is $84$ equal to, if $8\times 8 =54$?

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the polynomial $f(x)$ such that $f(7)=89183$, where the coefficient $a_i$ is such that $0 \le a_i < 7$.\\
\textbf{Hint:} Try to find the coefficients of the polynomial first. What does a polynomial represent?
\end{enumerate}
